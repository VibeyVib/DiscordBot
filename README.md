# DiscordBot
A collection? Of Discord Bots I've made and intend to make in the future


ImageBot: 
Allows for the user to obtain images from a local folder upon a command given by the client.

It is imperative to head over to https://discord.com/developers/applications to get started with the Bot creation.

Things to keep in mind:

1) Import all the necessary python modules as mentioned above
2) Replace the #comments with your own suitable commands/messages 
3) Replace #File Path with the suitable image folder directory, and replace backward slashes with forward slashes.
4) Finally, insert your secret token in the #your  token goes here, or you can also use a .env file
